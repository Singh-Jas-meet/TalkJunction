Below is the expected working of TalkJunction:

Upon opening the app, users encounter a straightforward login page where they can either sign up or log in.
Once authenticated, they are directed to a screen prompting them to select a topic of interest.
Upon choosing a topic, users simply press the connect button.
Behind the scenes, the app's backend algorithm diligently works to find a suitable chat partner, prioritizing availability.
If multiple users are available, the algorithm quickly matches the user with the first available chat partner.
The subsequent chat room activity allows users to exchange messages and explore the chosen topic.
However, this dynamic interaction is intentionally limited to 10 minutes, fostering concise and focused conversations.
Users also have the autonomy to end the activity prematurely, thanks to a designated button within the chat room interface. 


For Talk Junction, a non-relational database, specifically Firebase Real-Time Database, will be employed to ensure real-time data synchronization and seamless communication among users.
The expected collections within the database include:
User Collection:
  Fields: User ID, Username, Interests, Conversation History, etc.
  To store user-specific information and preferences.
Chat Rooms Collection:
  Fields: Topic, Participants, Messages, Timestamp, etc.
  To manage different conversation rooms based on selected topics.
Topic Collection:
  Fields: Topic ID, Name, Description, Users Interested, etc.
  To maintain a list of available topics and users interested in each.
Message Collection:
  Fields: Message ID, Sender ID, Receiver ID, Content, Timestamp, etc.
  To store messages exchanged within conversation rooms.


Below is an example of an anticipated database for two users of the application:
{
  "users": [
    {
      "userId": "user1",
      "username": "Alice",
      "interests": ["Technology", "Movies", "Books"],
      "conversationHistory": [
        {
          "roomId": "room123",
          "topic": "Technology",
          "messages": [
            {
              "messageId": "msg1",
              "senderId": "user1",
              "content": "Hi there! What's your favorite tech gadget?",
              "timestamp": "2022-02-01T14:30:00"
            },
            {
              "messageId": "msg2",
              "senderId": "user2",

              "timestamp": "2022-02-01T14:35:00"
            },
            {
              "messageId": "msg3",
              "senderId": "user1",
              "content": "I'm a fan of smartwatches. They're so versatile!",
              "timestamp": "2022-02-01T14:40:00"
            }
            // Additional messages can be added here
          ]
        }
        // Additional conversation history entries can be added here
      ]
    },
    {
      "userId": "user2",
      "username": "Bob",
      "interests": ["Sports", "Music", "Technology"],
      "conversationHistory": [
        {
          "roomId": "room123",
          "topic": "Technology",
          "messages": [
            {
              "messageId": "msg1",
              "senderId": "user1",
              "content": "Hi there! What's your favorite tech gadget?",
              "timestamp": "2022-02-01T14:30:00"
            },
            {
              "messageId": "msg2",
              "senderId": "user2",
              "content": "Hey! I love smartphones. How about you?",
              "timestamp": "2022-02-01T14:35:00"
            },
            {
              "messageId": "msg3",
              "senderId": "user1",
              "content": "I'm a fan of smartwatches. They're so versatile!",
              "timestamp": "2022-02-01T14:40:00"
            }
            // Additional messages can be added here
          ]
        }
        // Additional conversation history entries can be added here
      ]
    }
  ]
}
